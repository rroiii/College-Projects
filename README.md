# Task-Management
This is a task management program written in C for assignment in my university written by me and my friends.

This program is a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) program and already using file handling. So the data can be kept permanently. Moreover, this program has many features, such as sorting, searching, and update some data on it (data status and current data).

Linked list data structures is used as main data structures for this program. It is used for store task data. When you want to input data, program will create temporary node and ask for the input. Then that temporary node will be inserted at the end linked list which has existed. 

 The program can also calculate the number of task in each courses. That numbers are stored in a array.
 
Beside that, this program already has some error handling function, such as date detection, number of input, option input, and many more.
